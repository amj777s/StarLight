# Starlight

Starlight is an HTML/Javascript obstacles avoidance game. 

The goal of the game is quite simple, to score the most points by dodging objects with your mouse. Can play without signing in, but to have games saveed to highscores table,
you must be signed in.


This is my first true project building using a combination of typescript, next.js and vercel. Feedback is appreciated.

Currently the game only runs on desktop, but in the future starlight will be implemented with React Native to allow mobile play.
